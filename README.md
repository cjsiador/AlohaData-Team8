# ðŸ¤– Unity + Gemini AI Integration

This project demonstrates how to connect a Unity application to Google's Gemini Pro AI model using a Web API.

- **Unity Project**: Frontend interface where prompts are created and AI responses are displayed.
- **Web API**: A backend service that securely connects to Gemini Pro and sends back results to Unity.
- **Google Gemini API**: Large language model from Google, used for generating responses.
